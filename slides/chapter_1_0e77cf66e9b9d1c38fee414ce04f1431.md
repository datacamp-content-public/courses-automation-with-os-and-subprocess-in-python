`@script`
- This lesson covers capturing the output of shell commands using the subprocess.Popen module
- First we will talk about the subprocess.Popen Module
- Next we will talk about "with" statement and how it applies to Popen
- We will break down a real example
- Finally, the results of the example will be analyzed


---
## Using the subprocess.Popen module

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5fcd059c0a"
```

`@part1`
- Captures the output of shell commands{{1}}
- Preferred method of capturing output {{2}}


`@script`
_ subprocess.Popen module is used for capturing the output of a process.
- Preferred way of capturing output from python 2.7-3.6
- It should be noted that in Python 3.7, it is possible to use....
 
subprocess.run with  capture_output=True parameter to accomplish the same thing as Popen


---
## "with" statement

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d35cf4854b"
```

`@part1`
- Can use the context manager via"with" statement, i.e.:  {{1}}

      with Popen(["ls"], stdout=PIPE) as proc:


- "with" statement simplifies using Popen  {{2}}


`@script`
- Can use context manager via "with" statement as below:

- With statement simplifies using Popen, on exit the "with statement"....

- automatically waits for process to finish
- automatically closes file descriptors


---
## Breaking down a real example

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e25942afc8"
```

`@part1`
- Making files  {{1}}


     !touch /tmp/foo.txt /tmp/bar.txt 
{{2}}


- Using subprocess {{3}}



     from subprocess import (Popen, PIPE)

     with Popen(["ls", "/tmp"], stdout=PIPE) as proc:    
          result = proc.stdout.readlines()

{{4}}


`@script`
- Make a couple of files using IPython shell
- To use subprocess, first...
 
import Popen and PIPE from subprocess


- Next use Popen to capture the output and store the output into the result variable as a list


---
## Analyzing Results

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "87c103b38f"
```

`@part1`
- printing raw result {{1}}

      print(result)

      [b'bar.txt\n', b'foo.txt\n']
- print each file {{2}}

      for file in result:
         print(file.strip())

      b'bar.txt'
      b'foo.txt'


`@script`
- The result variable can be printed to show raw results

- All of the files can be printed out one by one....
 and the newlines can be stripped with a for loop...
and printed out


---
## Practicing with the subprocess.Popen module

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "7ebefa0b03"
```

`@script`
- Next let's practice what was covered in the lesson.
- The next section will test your knowledge on using Popen to:
  - capture the output of shell commands
  - use the with context manager  
  - pipe the output to stdout
  - format the results and print them out
